# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

## Postdocs
We currently don't have an open position for postdocs, but please feel free to reach me for potential future openings or collaboration opportunities.

## Graduate students
If you are interested in pursuing a master’s or doctoral degree with me at Soongsil Univ., please send me (kunwoo dot park at ssu dot ac dot kr) (i) a CV, (ii) the list of taken subjects during undergrads, and (iii) the description of a project you have participated that are most relevant to our research. **I would recommend students who plan to pursue an MS/Ph.D. degree first joining as undergraduate interns.**

## Undergraduate interns
Undergraduate interns will be given an opportunity to learn data science and machine learning skills and to participate in an ongoing research project by supporting data collection, analysis, and model implementation. 

- An ideal candidate is a junior (3학년) or senior (4학년) student in Soongsil, who is interested in our research and fluent in at least a programming language: fyi, we mainly use python.
- Prior experience in data science is not necessary, but it will be a plus. 
- You could be part of a study group of deep learning basics or recent technologies according to your interests. 

If you are interested, please email me (kunwoo dot park at ssu dot ac dot kr) with a brief introduction on your background.
