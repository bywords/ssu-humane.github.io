# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

## Postdocs
We currently don't have an open position for postdocs, but please feel free to reach me for potential future openings or collaboration opportunities.

## Graduate students
If you are interested in pursuing a masterâ€™s or doctoral degree with me at Soongsil Univ., please send me (kunwoo dot park at ssu dot ac dot kr) (i) a CV, (ii) the list of subjects you took during undergrads, and (iii) the description of the most relevant project you have participated. 

## Undergraduate interns
Undergraduate interns will participate in a reading group of recent machine learning technology, such as Transformer, GPT-3, and CLIP. They could join an ongoing research project and take a supporting role in data collection, analysis, and model implementation. If you are interested, please email me with a brief introduction. I recommend students who plan to pursue an MS/Ph.D. degree joining as undergraduate interns.
