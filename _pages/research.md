We are a **HUMAN-CENTERED** research group from three perspectives:
1. **Data**: we focus on digitally-logged human-generated data such as behavioral records, text, images, etc., in online platforms (e.g., news, social media).
2. **Problem**: we tackle human-centered social problems that emerge in online human behaviors and social interactions (e.g., misinformation).
3. **Method**: we study human-centered technical components in data-driven solutions that facilitate human usages, such as interpretability and causality.
