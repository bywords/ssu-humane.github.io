- title: "Learning to Detect Incongruence in News Headline and Body Text via a Graph Neural Network"
  image: yoon_access21.png
  description: This paper tackles the problem of detecting incongruities between headlines and body text, where a news headline is irrelevant or even in opposition to the information in its body. Our model, called the graph-based hierarchical dual encoder (GHDE), utilizes a graph neural network to efficiently learn the content similarity between news headlines and long body paragraphs. This paper also releases a million-item-scale dataset of incongruity labels that can be used for training. The experimental results show that the proposed graph-based neural network model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by a substantial margin (5.3%) on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Real-world experiments on recent news articles confirm that the trained model successfully detects headline incongruities. We discuss the implications of these findings for combating infodemics and news fatigue.

- title: "How-to present news on social media: A causal analysis of editing news headlines for boosting user engagement"
  image: park_icwsm21.png
  description: To reach a broader audience and optimize traffic toward news articles, media outlets commonly run social media accounts and share their content with a short text summary. Despite its importance of writing a compelling message in sharing articles, research community does not own a sufficient level of understanding of what kinds of editing strategies are effective in promoting audience engagement. In this study, we aim to fill the gap by analyzing the current practices of media outlets using a data-driven approach. We first build a parallel corpus of original news articles and their corresponding tweets that were shared by eight media outlets. Then, we explore how those media edited tweets against original headlines, and the effects would be. To estimate the effects of editing news headlines for social media sharing in audience engagement, we present a systematic analysis that incorporates a causal inference technique with deep learning; using propensity score matching, it allows for estimating potential (dis-) advantages of an editing style compared to counterfactual cases where a similar news article is shared with a different style. According to the analyses of various editing styles, we report common and differing effects of the styles across the outlets. To understand the effects of various editing styles, media outlets could apply our easy-to-use tool by themselves.

- title: "BaitWatcher: A Lightweight Web Interface for the Detection of Incongruent News Headlines"
  image: park_fndm20.png
  description: In digital environments where substantial amounts of information are shared online, news headlines play essential roles in the selection and diffusion of news articles. Some news articles attract audience attention by showing exaggerated or misleading headlines. This study addresses the headline incongruity problem, in which a news headline makes claims that are either unrelated or opposite to the contents of the corresponding article. We present BaitWatcher, which is a lightweight web interface that guides readers in estimating the likelihood of incongruence in news articles before clicking on the headlines. BaitWatcher utilizes a hierarchical recurrent encoder that efficiently learns complex textual representations of a news headline and its associated body text. For training the model, we construct a million scale dataset of news articles, which we also release for broader research use. Based on the results of a focus group interview, we discuss the importance of developing an interpretable AI agent for the design of a better interface for mitigating the effects of online misinformation.

- title: "Trust Me, I Have a Ph. D.: A Propensity Score Analysis on the Halo Effect of Disclosing One's Offline Social Status in Online Communities"
  image: park_icwsm20.png
  description: Online communities adopt various reputation schemes to measure content quality. This study analyzes the effect of a new reputation scheme that exposes one's offline social status, such as an education degree, within an online community. We study two Reddit communities that adopted this scheme, whereby posts include tags identifying education status referred to as flairs, and we examine how the “transferred” social status affects the interactions among the users. We computed propensity scores to test whether flairs give ad-hoc authority to the adopters while minimizing the effects of confounding variables such as topics of content. The results show that exposing academic degrees is likely to lead to higher audience votes as well as larger discussion size, compared to the users without the disclosed identities, in a community that covers peer-reviewed scientific articles. In another community with a focus on casual science topics, exposing mere academic degrees did not obtain such benefits. Still, the users with the highest degree (eg, Ph. D. or MD) were likely to receive more feedback from the audience. These findings suggest that reputation schemes that link the offline and online worlds could induce halo effects on feedback behaviors differently depending upon the community culture. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of future reputation mechanisms.

- title: "Detecting incongruity between news headline and body text via a deep hierarchical encoder"
  image: yoon_aaai19.png
  description: Some news headlines mislead readers with overrated or false information, and identifying them in advance will better assist readers in choosing proper news stories to consume. This research introduces million-scale pairs of news headline and body text dataset with incongruity label, which can uniquely be utilized for detecting news stories with misleading headlines. On this dataset, we develop two neural networks with hierarchical architectures that model a complex textual representation of news articles and measure the incongruity between the headline and the body text. We also present a data augmentation method that dramatically reduces the text input size a model handles by independently investigating each paragraph of news stories, which further boosts the performance. Our experiments and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches and efficiently detect news stories with misleading headlines in the real world.

- title: "Positivity Bias in Customer Satisfaction Ratings"
  image: park_www18.png
  description: Customer ratings are valuable sources to understand their satisfaction and are critical for designing better customer experiences and recommendations. The majority of customers, however, do not respond to rating surveys, which makes the result less representative. To understand overall satisfaction, this paper aims to investigate how likely customers without responses had satisfactory experiences compared to those respondents. To infer customer satisfaction of such unlabeled sessions, we propose models using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that learn continuous representations of unstructured text conversation. By analyzing online chat logs of over 170,000 sessions from Samsung's customer service department, we make a novel finding that while labeled sessions contributed by a small fraction of customers received overwhelmingly positive reviews, the majority of unlabeled sessions would have received lower ratings by customers. The data analytics presented in this paper not only have practical implications for helping detect dissatisfied customers on live chat services but also make theoretical contributions on discovering the level of biases in online rating platforms.

  image: park_www17.png
  description: Retaining players over an extended period of time is a long-standing challenge in game industry. Significant effort has been paid to understanding what motivates players enjoy games. While individuals may have varying reasons to play or abandon a game at different stages within the game, previous studies have looked at the retention problem from a snapshot view. This study, by analyzing in-game logs of 51,104 distinct individuals in an online multiplayer game, uniquely offers a multifaceted view of the retention problem over the players' virtual life phases. We find that key indicators of longevity change with the game level. Achievement features are important for players at the initial to the advanced phases, yet social features become the most predictive of longevity once players reach the highest level offered by the game. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for designing online games that are adaptive to meeting the players' needs.

- title: "Persistent Sharing of Fitness App Status on Twitter"
  image: park_cscw16.png
  description: As the world becomes more digitized and interconnected, information that was once considered to be private such as one's health status is now being shared publicly. To understand this new phenomenon better, it is crucial to study what types of health information are being shared on social media and why, as well as by whom. In this paper, we study the traits of users who share their personal health and fitness related information on social media by analyzing fitness status updates that MyFitnessPal users have shared via Twitter. We investigate how certain features like user profile, fitness activity, and fitness network in social media can potentially impact the long-term engagement of fitness app users. We also discuss implications of our findings to achieve a better retention of these users and to promote more sharing of their status updates.

- title: "Mining the Minds of Customers from Online Chat Logs"
  image: park_cikm15.png
  description: This study investigates factors that may determine satisfaction in customer service operations. We utilized more than 170,000 online chat sessions between customers and agents to identify characteristics of chat sessions that incurred dissatisfying experience. Quantitative data analysis suggests that sentiments or moods conveyed in online conversation are the most predictive factor of perceived satisfaction. Conversely, other session related meta data (such as that length, time of day, and response time) has a weaker correlation with user satisfaction. Knowing in advance what can predict satisfaction allows customer service staffs to identify potential weaknesses and improve the quality of service for better customer experience.

  image: lou_www13.png
  description: Modern Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) provide lifelike virtual environments in which players can conduct a variety of activities including combat, trade, and chat with other players. While the game world and the available actions therein are inspired by their offline counterparts, the games' popularity and dedicated fan base are testaments to the allure of novel social interactions granted to people by allowing them an alternative life as a new character and persona. In this paper we investigate the phenomenon of "gender swapping," which refers to players choosing avatars of genders opposite to their natural ones. We report the behavioral patterns observed in players of Fairyland Online, a globally serviced MMORPG, during social interactions when playing as in-game avatars of their own real gender or gender-swapped. We also discuss the effect of gender role and self-image in virtual social situations and the potential of our study for improving MMORPG quality and detecting online identity frauds.
