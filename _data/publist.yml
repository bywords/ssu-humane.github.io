  image: yoon_access21.png
  description: This paper tackles the problem of detecting incongruities between headlines and body text, where a news headline is irrelevant or even in opposition to the information in its body. Our model, called the graph-based hierarchical dual encoder (GHDE), utilizes a graph neural network to efficiently learn the content similarity between news headlines and long body paragraphs. This paper also releases a million-item-scale dataset of incongruity labels that can be used for training. The experimental results show that the proposed graph-based neural network model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by a substantial margin (5.3%) on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Real-world experiments on recent news articles confirm that the trained model successfully detects headline incongruities. We discuss the implications of these findings for combating infodemics and news fatigue.

- title: "Automatically Detecting Image–Text Mismatch on Instagram with Deep Learning"
  image: ha_ja21.png
  description: Visual social media have emerged as an essential brand communication channel for advertisers and brands. The active use of hashtags has enabled advertisers to identify customers interested in their brands and better understand their consumers. However, some users post brand-incongruent content—for example, posts composed of brand-irrelevant images with brand-relevant hashtags. Such visual information mismatch can be problematic because it hinders other consumers’ information search processes and advertisers’ insight generation from consumer-initiated social media data. This study aims to characterize visually mismatched content in brand-related posts on Instagram and builds a visual information mismatch detection model using computer vision. We propose a machine-learning model based on three cues: image, text, and metadata. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of deep learning and the importance of combining text and image features for mismatch detection. We discuss the advantages of machine-learning methods as a novel research tool for advertising research and conclude with implications of our findings.

- title: "Understanding Gender Stereotypes and Electoral Success from Visual Self-presentations of Politicians in Social Media"
  description: Social media have been widely used as a platform for political communication, promoting firsthand dialogue between politicians and the public. This paper studies the role of visual self-presentation in social media in political campaigns with a primary focus on gender stereotypical cues exhibited in Facebook timeline posts of 562 candidates in the 2018 U.S. general elections. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that infers gender stereotypes from the photographs based on crowdsourced annotations. Using regression analysis, we find that masculine traits are predictive factors for winning elections for both gender and parties. In contrast, feminine traits are not correlated with electoral success. Prediction experiments show that the visual traits on gender stereotypes can predict the election outcomes with an accuracy of 0.739, which was better than the performance (0.724) of making a direct prediction from the raw photographs. Our study demonstrates that the automated visual content analysis can reliably measure subtle, emotional, and subjective personal trait dimensions from political images, thereby enabling systematic investigations on multi-modal political communication via social media.

 - title: "How-to present news on social media: A causal analysis of editing news headlines for boosting user engagement"
  image: park_icwsm21.png
  description: To reach a broader audience and optimize traffic toward news articles, media outlets commonly run social media accounts and share their content with a short text summary. Despite its importance of writing a compelling message in sharing articles, research community does not own a sufficient level of understanding of what kinds of editing strategies are effective in promoting audience engagement. In this study, we aim to fill the gap by analyzing the current practices of media outlets using a data-driven approach. We first build a parallel corpus of original news articles and their corresponding tweets that were shared by eight media outlets. Then, we explore how those media edited tweets against original headlines, and the effects would be. To estimate the effects of editing news headlines for social media sharing in audience engagement, we present a systematic analysis that incorporates a causal inference technique with deep learning; using propensity score matching, it allows for estimating potential (dis-) advantages of an editing style compared to counterfactual cases where a similar news article is shared with a different style. According to the analyses of various editing styles, we report common and differing effects of the styles across the outlets. To understand the effects of various editing styles, media outlets could apply our easy-to-use tool by themselves.

 - title: "BaitWatcher: A Lightweight Web Interface for the Detection of Incongruent News Headlines"
  image: park_fndm20.png
  description: In digital environments where substantial amounts of information are shared online, news headlines play essential roles in the selection and diffusion of news articles. Some news articles attract audience attention by showing exaggerated or misleading headlines. This study addresses the headline incongruity problem, in which a news headline makes claims that are either unrelated or opposite to the contents of the corresponding article. We present BaitWatcher, which is a lightweight web interface that guides readers in estimating the likelihood of incongruence in news articles before clicking on the headlines. BaitWatcher utilizes a hierarchical recurrent encoder that efficiently learns complex textual representations of a news headline and its associated body text. For training the model, we construct a million scale dataset of news articles, which we also release for broader research use. Based on the results of a focus group interview, we discuss the importance of developing an interpretable AI agent for the design of a better interface for mitigating the effects of online misinformation.

 - title: '"Trust Me, I Have a Ph. D.": A Propensity Score Analysis on the Halo Effect of Disclosing One's Offline Social Status in Online Communities'
  image: park_icwsm20.png
  description: Online communities adopt various reputation schemes to measure content quality. This study analyzes the effect of a new reputation scheme that exposes one's offline social status, such as an education degree, within an online community. We study two Reddit communities that adopted this scheme, whereby posts include tags identifying education status referred to as flairs, and we examine how the “transferred” social status affects the interactions among the users. We computed propensity scores to test whether flairs give ad-hoc authority to the adopters while minimizing the effects of confounding variables such as topics of content. The results show that exposing academic degrees is likely to lead to higher audience votes as well as larger discussion size, compared to the users without the disclosed identities, in a community that covers peer-reviewed scientific articles. In another community with a focus on casual science topics, exposing mere academic degrees did not obtain such benefits. Still, the users with the highest degree (eg, Ph. D. or MD) were likely to receive more feedback from the audience. These findings suggest that reputation schemes that link the offline and online worlds could induce halo effects on feedback behaviors differently depending upon the community culture. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of future reputation mechanisms.
